What Data Story do you have to tell:	Anyone who's attended a civic hackathon probably felt great afterward. What's not to feel great about? You just wrote code that MADE A DIFFERENCE! But anyone who's followed up on a project after a civic technology hackathon has probably found nothing but shame, disappointment, and a lack of analysis. For the most part, throwing dots on maps chock-full of civic data have ceased to be meaningful.
