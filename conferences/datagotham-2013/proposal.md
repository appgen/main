# What data story do you have to tell?
Nobody can deny the success of NYC's open data portal. It has become an essential public resource, driving the development in new fields of civic technology, transparency, and analysis of the public sector. And yet, these datasets are often explored in a rather analysis-free way: someone take a dataset and throws it on a map. Data science is not just about working with big data; it involves substantive analytical rigor and effective communication of findings.

AppGen takes a novel approach to raise the level of discourse: Computationally creating all possible data mashups from the NYC open data portal, then submitting them as standalone apps to civic app challenges. Automatically.

AppGen takes all the datasets from the NYC Data Portal, analyzes them to find stochastic linkages, then visualizes them in the form of standalone apps. It is the most efficient way to rapidly prototype and spatially understand NYC Open Data as interactive, story-telling apps. 

This talk will discuss the factors that went into building the AppGen data exploration system, the challenges of algorithmically generating an app (This includes merging disparate datasets, writing product copy and composing visual brands), and how to use AppGen to explore any class of civic dataset.
