AppGen: Data portal exploration through stochastic stories

New York City has been a leader in the release of open data

Nobody can deny the success of NYC's open data portal. It has become an essential public resource, driving the development in new fields of civic technology, transparency, and analysis of the public sector. And yet, these datasets are often manifested in a rather analysis-free way: someone takes whatever the data is, throws it on a map, and submits it to a hackathon. In essence, they forget the principle that data science should not only be about working with big data, but bringing substantive analytical rigor and effective communication of findings.

AppGen takes a novel approach to raise the level of discourse: automating the creation of all possible data mashups from the NYC open data portal, then submitting them as standalone apps to civic app challenges. Automatically.

AppGen takes all the datasets from the NYC Data Portal, analyzes them to find stochastic linkages, then visualizes them in the form of standalone apps. It's at once the most efficient way to rapidly prototype spatial understanding of NYC Open Data to identify reasonable linkages and a remarkably comical and useful way of exploring the datasets. 

This talk will discuss the factors that went into building the AppGen data exploration system, the challenges of automatically generating an app (including how to algorithmically writing product copy and contest submissions), and how to use AppGen to explore any class of civic dataset.
