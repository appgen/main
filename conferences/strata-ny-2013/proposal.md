Audience Level 

Prerequisite Knowledge for this Session 

Tutorial prerequisites 
If you are submitting a proposal for a tutorial, what materials or downloads will attendees need in advance of your tutorial (e.g., a GitHub account, most current version of MySQL, a laptop, etc.)?


Video URL 
While not compulsory, video clips of the speaker will count favorably toward your proposal. If you don’t have video of the speaker in action at an event, please create a very short clip (2-3 minutes) proposing the session. We don’t care about the quality of the video, we care about the quality of the speakers. If your video isn’t already online, post it to a third-party site (YouTube is fine), and then share the link with us.


O'Reilly Author 
If you are an author or content contributor at O’Reilly, please fill in the name of your main O’Reilly editorial contact.


Did someone recommend or encourage you to submit a proposal? If so, please let us know who sent you. 

Does your presentation have the participation of a woman, person of color or member of another group often underrepresented at tech conferences? *	
Diversity is one of the factors we seriously consider when reviewing proposals as we seek to broaden our speaker roster.

We may also want to contact you for other O’Reilly content creation opportunities such writing, webcasts, etc. By submitting a proposal, you agree that O’Reilly may contact you about these other activities.
