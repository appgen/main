## Proposal title *
AppGen: Raising the Discourse about Big Data via Automated Random Prototyping

## Description * (brief overview for marketing purposes, max. length 400 characters—about 65 words)
Civic data is great
however, there is a crisis of quality
how do we qualify these datasets?

Appgen, uniquely targets the superset of open data. 

AppGen takes all the datasets from the NYC Data Portal, analyzes them to find stochastic linkages, merges disparate datasets, visualizes them in the form of standalone apps, writes product copy and composes a visual brand. This novel approach to rapidly prototyping facilitates the spatial understanding of NYC Open Data as interactive, story-telling apps.

Abstract *

AppGen is a rapid prototyping tool that allows one to browse the superset of open civic datasets in the form of standalone, fully functional and branded web applications. It takes all the datasets from the NYC Data Portal, analyzes them to find stochastic linkages, merges disparate datasets, visualizes them in the form of standalone apps, writes product copy and composes a visual brand. 

We think it has value in a Sokal hoax kind of way, as an invective against the redundancy of civic applications and arbitrariness of hackathon judging. But additionally, because it uniquely targets the superset of civic data, it could be used to gather analytics on the join-ability/usability/hack-ability of specific open datasets in relation to each other, and through this quantification, serve as an assessment tool re: the success/failure of any govt/dept's open data efforts.

AppGen is a rapid prototyping tool that allows one to browse the superset of open civic datasets in the form of standalone, fully functional and branded web applications. 

Because AppGen targets the superset of this data, and allows one to quickly scan multiple datasets in sequence and at scale, AppGen facilitates the comparison 

AppGen is a service designed to elevate the level of discourse around public civic data set quality and the quality of analysis.


** Issues around interoperability, value of published datasets
*** Limited oversight, accountability for mediocre public data

Audience Level 

Prerequisite Knowledge for this Session 
Familiarity with open data, civic technology space, experience with hackathons are a plus, but not requried.

Tutorial prerequisites 
If you are submitting a proposal for a tutorial, what materials or downloads will attendees need in advance of your tutorial (e.g., a GitHub account, most current version of MySQL, a laptop, etc.)?


Video URL 
While not compulsory, video clips of the speaker will count favorably toward your proposal. If you don’t have video of the speaker in action at an event, please create a very short clip (2-3 minutes) proposing the session. We don’t care about the quality of the video, we care about the quality of the speakers. If your video isn’t already online, post it to a third-party site (YouTube is fine), and then share the link with us.


O'Reilly Author 
If you are an author or content contributor at O’Reilly, please fill in the name of your main O’Reilly editorial contact.


Did someone recommend or encourage you to submit a proposal? If so, please let us know who sent you. 

Does your presentation have the participation of a woman, person of color or member of another group often underrepresented at tech conferences? 

Yes


Other O'Reilly Content Opportunities 
We may also want to contact you for other O’Reilly content creation opportunities such writing, webcasts, etc. By submitting a proposal, you agree that O’Reilly may contact you about these other activities.
