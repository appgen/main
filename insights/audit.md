Guidelines

* Columns should be appropriately typed.
* Datasets should not be tagged with meaningless ones like "percent".
* Dataset descriptions should not contain metadata, specifically update frequency.
* Datasets should be in raw, un-aggregated, un-subsetted form.
* Datasets should be in long format rather than in wide format.
* Downloads shouldn't be prohibitively slow.
* Don't split one table across multiple datasets (by borough or year).
* Maps and datasets should be the same concept.
* Titles should describe the dataset.
* Words should be spelled correctly.

General questions

* Who updates which datasets?
* Which departments do the datasets come from?
* How big are the datasets (in rows, columns and bytes)?
* Which DOIT employees and data sources are best/worst?
* How joinable are datasets?
* How unionable are datasets?
* What explains variation in dataset quality?
